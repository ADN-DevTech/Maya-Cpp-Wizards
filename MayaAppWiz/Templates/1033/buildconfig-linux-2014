# Plug-ins are written by separate developers. Each of them might

# times, it occurs that plug-ins written by different developers are
# using different and "incompatible" versions of the same library. To

# versions of these libraries. And, by hidding the symbols of these
# libraries, we prevent the two incompatible versions of the library
# from interferring with each others.
